3.  Shifters

I am not sure I have understood properly what is meant with a "selector" and
how to determine the number and size of a required selector due to an absolute
lack of background in such low-level digital circuit design, so please take the
below answers with a grain of salt.

>> `naiveShfl` uses 16 256-to-16 muxes if `shftAmnt` is dynamic. This is due to
   the dynamic indexing into the `in` vector inside of the for loop. When the
   loop is unrolled into its 16 iterations, we need 16 selectors. Each of the
   selectors selects a word (here defined as 16 bit, therefore a `to-16` mux)
   of the input vector, which holds 16 words (therefore 16*16 bit = 256 bit
   input to the mux). If we talk about the selectors in terms of word size
   instead of number of bits, the total number of selectors doesn't change but
   we'd have 16-to-1 selectors instead (selecting one word out of 16).

>> If `shftAmnt` is constant, `naiveShfl` does not use any selectors at all.
   The unrolled for loop would just result in a fixed rewiring of words from
   one position in the vector to another without the requirement of selecting
   a word dynamically.

>> Assuming that we have implementations of `naiveShfl` with fixed shift
   amounts 1, 2, 4, 8 (that do not require any selectors at all as explained in
   the answer to the second question), my barrel shifter implementation
   requires 4 4-to-1 selectors. In the for loops' body, I select a bit from the
   4-bit `shftAmnt` input 4 times. This bit determines whether the input is
   shifted by the corresponding power of 2 or not.
